# Hi there üëã:rocket:

## :sparkles: About me

üíª I am currently seeking a job as a junior engineer on GitHub that would provide me with growth opportunities and allow me to learn new things.

üëç I am an open-minded, active, and sociable individual. While I occasionally exhibit introverted tendencies, I enjoy meeting new people, gaining diverse experiences, and surrounding myself with others. I am highly motivated by new challenges, as they drive me to push myself even further.

üìö In my free time, as a programmer, I enjoy engaging in logical puzzles and playing computer games.

Logical puzzles present fascinating challenges for me. I enjoy analyzing different problems and seeking creative solutions. Solving puzzles requires abstract thinking, logical reasoning, and pattern recognition skills. It's a great mental exercise and an excellent way to enhance problem-solving abilities.

Computer games are also a passion of mine. They not only provide entertainment but also allow me to explore new worlds, engage in mental challenges, and build strategies. I find joy in immersing myself in captivating stories, solving puzzles, and competing with other players online. Computer games offer me a perfect blend of relaxation and the opportunity to develop skills such as observation, concentration, and quick decision-making.

To sum up, in my free time as a programmer, I love solving logical puzzles and diving into computer games. It's not only a form of leisure for me but also a means of sharpening my mental abilities and deriving pleasure from creative thinking.
